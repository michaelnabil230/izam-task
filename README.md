## 📚 Development Guidelines

### Backend

* API routes defined in `routes/api.php`
* Models located in `app/Models`
* Controllers in `app/Http/Controllers`
* Event-driven architecture for order notifications (OrderPlaced event)
* **API Endpoints:**
  * `GET /products` — Retrieve all products with filtering (by name, price range, category) and pagination
  * `GET /products/{id}` — Retrieve details for a single product
  * `GET /orders` — Retrieve all orders with caching and pagination
  * `GET /orders/{id}` — Retrieve a single order’s details (products, quantities, total)
  * `POST /orders` — Place a new order with product availability and quantity validation

### Frontend

* React components in `resources/js/`
* TypeScript interfaces in `resources/js/types/`
* Axios handles API requests
* No use of Inertia.js — direct REST API calls only

---

## 📬 API Testing

The project includes a **Postman collection file** for quick testing of all API endpoints.
You’ll find it in the root of the repository as:

```
postman_collection.json
```

This file contains sample requests for:

* Product listing, filtering, and details
* Order creation
* Order listing and details retrieval

Simply import this collection into **Postman** and adjust the base URL and authorization token (if required) to match your local development environment.
